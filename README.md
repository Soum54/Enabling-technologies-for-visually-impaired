Girlathon 2024, an inclusive hackathon exclusively designed for those who identify as women. Organized by the Google Developers Student Club (GDSC) at Mar Athanasius College of Engineering (MACE), Girlathon aims to advance and excel women in technology by fostering innovation and problem-solving. 

This event provides proficient mentorship, guidance, and support to encourage and celebrate women's participation in STEM fields. 
# Project Overview
I'm working on a project called Enabling Technologies for Visually Impaired People, where I'm using object detection techniques to identify objects in front of blind individuals. The goal is to convey this information through optical glasses or other means, alerting them as obstacles present in their path.
# Project Aim/Objective
The project focuses on receiving input from the camera used by the disabled person and performing object detection. The system will mark boundaries around detected objects and inform the individual that an obstacle is present, prompting them to move aside. This is the basic concept and aim of the project.
